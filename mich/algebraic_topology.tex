% trefoil picture goes here (trefoil ~> unknot)

\paragraph{Question 1} Is the trefoil really a knot?
How do we make this precise?

We can think of the trefoil and the unknot as continuous embeddings:
\begin{equation}
    S^1 \to \R^3
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Question 1 (precise)} Is there a continuous map
\begin{equation}
    F:S^1 \times [0, 1] \to \R^3
\end{equation}
such that
\begin{itemize}
    \item $F(\theta, 0) = f_0(\theta)$, $F(\theta, 1) = f_1(\theta)$ $\forall \theta \in S^1$
    \item $F(\cdot, t_0): S^1 \to \R^3$ is injective, $\forall t_0 \in [0, 1]$
\end{itemize}

We phrased unknotting as an ``extension problem''.  We can think about other, easier to state extension problems.

\paragraph{Question 2} Consider $S^2 = \{\vec{x} \in \R^3 \mid ||x|| = 1\}$, and $D^3 = \{\vec{x} \in \R^3 \mid ||x|| \leq 1\}$ along with the natural inclusion $i: S^2 \to D^3$.  Does there exist a continuous $f: D^3 \to S^2$ such that $f \circ i = id_{S^2}$?
% picture if i can be bothered
This seems like a hard question!  So, let's instead consider this analogous question in algebra.  We take $S^2$ analogous to $\Z$, and $D^3$ analogous to $0$, the trivial group. From here, we get
\paragraph{Question 3} Does there exist a group homomorphism $f: 0 \to \Z$ such that $id_\Z = f \circ 0$?

This question seems much easier to solve! This is the essence of algebraic topology - we turn difficult questions in topology into easy questions about algebra.

\subsection{Examples and conventions}
Zoo of examples

\begin{itemize}
    \item Point $*$
    \item Circle $S^1$
    \item The circle generalises to the $n$-sphere, $S^{n-1} = \{x \in \R^n \mid ||x|| = 1\}$
    \item But also can be used to produce the torus $T^2 = S^1 \times S^1$.
        % more damn pictures
    \item Which itself generalises into the ``genus-g surface'', $\Sigma_g$
    \item $K$ Klein bottle
    \item $\R P^2$, the real projective plane
\end{itemize}

In this course, the term map always refers to a continuous map.
To check that a map is continuous, we'll almost always use
\begin{lemma}[The Gluing Lemma]
    If $X = C_1 \cup C_2$, with $C_i$ closed, and $f: X \to Y$ is a function such that $f\mid_{C_1}$ and $f\vert_{C_2}$ are both continuous, then $f$ is continuous.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Let $D \subseteq Y$ be closed.  Then
    \begin{equation}
        f^{-1}(D) = (f\vert_{C_1})^{-1} (D) \cup (f\vert_{C_2})^{-1} (D)
    \end{equation}
    is a finite union of closed sets, hence is closed.  Therefore, $f$ is continuous.
\end{proof}
\subsection{Cell complexes}
There are the spaces we can build by gluing.  The \textbf{basic operation} we use is to attach an $n$-dimensional disc, as shown in the non-existent diagram.
Formally, if $f: S^{n-1} \to X$ is a continuous map, then we produce
\begin{equation}
    (X \sqcup D^n) / \sim
\end{equation}
where $\sim$ is an equivalence relation: $Y \sim f(y)$, for $y \in S^{n-1}$ and $f(y) \in X$.
\begin{defi}[Cell complexes]
    We define cell complexes by induction:
    \begin{enumerate}[(i)] %roman lower
        \item A zero-dimensional cell complex is a finite discrete topological space
        \item An $n$-dimensional cell complex is constructed from an $(n-1)$ dimensional cell complex $X$ by attaching finitely many $n$-dimensional discs to $X$
    \end{enumerate}
\end{defi}
\end{document}
