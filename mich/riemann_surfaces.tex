\section{Complex analysis and complex log}

\begin{defi}
    A smooth function $f: U \to \C$ (where $U$ is a domain in $\C$) is \textbf{holomorphic} or \textbf{analytic} if either of the following equivalent statements hold:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
        \item $f$ is differentiable at all points of $U$, where differentiability is defined by limits, and checked by the Cauchy-Riemann equations
        \item $\forall a \in U$, $f$ has a power series expansion on a neighbourhood of $a$:
            \begin{equation*}
                f(z) = \sum_{n \geq 0} a_n (z - a)^n
            \end{equation*}
            and the series converges on some disk about $a$ with positive radius.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{defi}
\begin{proof}[Sketch of proof of equivalence]

    \leavevmode

    $(\Rightarrow)$ Use the Cauchy Integral Formula to construct $a_n$, and convergence.

    $(\Leftarrow)$ Show directly that the term-by-term derivative exists, and that it agrees with the limit definition of the derivative.
\end{proof}

Note that a power series tells you about local behaviour.
If $f(z)$ is not identically zero near $a \in U$, there exists some minimal $n_0$ such that $a_{n_0} \neq 0$.
We can write $f$ locally as
\begin{align*}
    f(z) &= a_{n_0} (z-a)^{n_0} + \sum_{n \ge n_0} a_n (z-a)^n \\
         &= a_{n_0} (z-a)^{n_0} \left(1 + \sum_{n>n_0} \frac{a_n}{a_{n_0}} (z-a)^{n-n_0}\right)
\end{align*}
As $z \to a$, the sum $\to 0$ so the quantity in the brackets tends to 1.  So, $f(z) = a_{n_0} (z-a)^{n_0} g(z)$, where $g$ is analytic and nonzero on a neighbourhood of $a$.
Consequently, we have the \emph{principle of isolated zeros}: for $f$ analytic on domain $U$, then for all $a \in U$ such that $f(a) = 0$, either $f$ is identically $0$ on a neighbourhood of $a$, or $f$ is never $0$ on a punctured disk centred at $a$.  But recall a domain refers to an open \emph{and connected} set.  So, if $f$ is identically $0$ (improve this writing) on a neighbourhood of $a$, call it $D_a$.  If $f \ne 0$ on a punctured disk about $a$, call it $P_a^*$. Construct
\begin{align}
    V = \bigcup_{\substack{a \in U \text{such that} \\ f \equiv 0 \text{on a neighbourhood of} a}} D_a
    % W = \cup_{a \in U such that f \ne 0 on a punctured neighbourhood of a} P_a^*
\end{align}

$V$ and $W$ are open, disjoint and $V \cup W = U$. Since $U$ is connected, $U=V$ or $U=W$. So either $f \equiv 0$ on $U$, or $f$ has only isolated zeros.
This will both be referred to as the principle of isolated zeros.

(corollary) (identity principle)
If $f$ and $g$ are analytic on $U$, then either $f \equiv g$ on $U$, or ${z \in U : f(z) = g(z)}$ consists of isolated points.
Proof (clear)

(definition)
If f is analytic on a punctured disk $\mathbb{D}^*(a,r)$, then we say $a$ is an isolated singularity of $f$.
If so, then there exists a Laurent expansion $\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} a_n (z-a)^n$ near $a$, which come in three types.

I. Removable singularity. $f$ extends to an analytic function on $\mathbb{D}^*{a, r}$. Phrased in terms of Laurent expansions, $a_n = 0 \forall n < 0$.
(thm) (Removable singularities theorem) $f$ has a removable singularity at $a$ if and only if $f$ is bounded on a punctured neighbourhood about $a$.
(proof sketch) (=>) follows from continuity of analytic functions
(<=) Cauchy's theorem and integral formula still hold for punctured neighbourhoods so long as $f(z) (z-a) \to 0$ as $z \to a$.  With a small circle about $a$, we can show directly that $a_n = 0$ for $n < 0$.

II. Poles: $f$ has a pole at $a$ if $a_n = 0$ for all $n < n_0$ for some $n_0$. Locally, this occurs if and only if $|f(z)| \to \infty$ as $z \to a$ (using the Laurent series).

III. Essential singularity: $a_n \neq 0$ for finitely many $n < 0$, f has an essential singularity at $a$.
thm [Casorati-Weierstrass] If $f$ has an essential singularity at $a$, then the image of $f$ on any punctured neighbourhood of $a$ is dense in $\mathbb{C}$.
(proof sketch) Examine $\frac1{f(z) - \gamma}$ if the image of $f$ misses a neighbourhood of $\gamma$.

\paragraph{Examples}
$f(z) = \frac1{e^z - 1}$ has poles wherever $e^z = 1$.
At $\infty$, we also have an isolated singularity, recalling that punctured neighbourhoods of $\infty$ are $\mathbb{C}\\ \mathbb{D}(0, R)$. Since $e^z$ takes all nonzero values or strips of $\mathbb{C}$, we cannot have $e^z \to 1$ as $z \to \infty$, hence $f$ cannot have a pole.  On the other hand, there exists arbitrarily large solutions (in modulus) to $e^z = 1$, and $f$ cannot have a removable singularity at $\infty$.  Hence, this singularity is essential.

(edit: not isolated as every neighbourhood of infinity contains a singularity)

\subsection{Complex logarithm}
The complex logarithm is an example of a multivalued function, which arises as the inverse of an analytic function. Given nonzero $z$, if $e^w = z$, $z = r e^{i \theta}$, then $w = \log r + (2 \pi n + \theta i)$ for some $n \in \mathbb{Z}$.  We cannot make a continuous choice of $n$ on all of $\mathbb{C}$, so we define the complex log on domains like $\mathbb{C} \\ \mathbb{R}_{\leq 0} =: U$. We have for each $n$, a choice of logarithm which can be analytically defined on $U$.  Recall a \emph{continuous} inverse of an analytic function is analytic.

Let $U_1 = \C \setminus \R_{\geq 0}$.

\begin{prop}
    For $n \in \Z$, define $h(z)$ on $U$, by
    \begin{equation*}
        h(z) = \int_{-1}^z \frac{dw}{w} + (2n+1) \pi i
    \end{equation*}
    with integral along straight line joining $-1$ and $z$.

    Then $h$ is analytic on $U_1$ and is the inverse to the exponential function on $U_1$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
    Let $z \in U_1$. $\tau \in \C$ with $\abs{\tau}$ sufficiently small, such that the triangle is entirely in the domain.

    Then claim $\frac{h(z + \tau) - h(z)}{\tau} = \frac1{\tau} \int_z^{z+\tau} \frac{dw}{w} \to \frac1z$.
    The first equality follows from Cauchy's theorem, since $h$ is continuous in the triangle.

    \begin{align*}
        \abs{\frac{1}{\tau} \int_z^{z + \tau} \frac{dw}{w} - \frac12} &= \abs{\frac1{\tau} \int_z^{z+\tau} \frac{z-w}{zw} dw} \\
        &\leq C \tau \to 0
    \end{align*}


    Thus $h$ is analytic on $U_1$, with $h'(z) = \frac{1}{z}$.

    Look at $g(z) = \frac{e^{h(z)}}{z}$, so $g'(z) = \frac{z h'(z) e^{h(z)} - e^{h(z)}}{z^2} = 0$, thus $g$ is constant. But, we still need to find out what it's value us, so consider $g(-1)$. $g(-1) = \frac{e^{h(-1)}}{-1} = -e^{(2n+1) \pi i} = 1$.
    Thus, $e^{h(z)} \equiv z$ on $U_1$, so $h$ is the inverse to the exponential.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
    We can't extend the function $H$ continuously across the positive real axis.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Analytic continuation}
Fix a domain $U \in \C$ which is path connected.

\begin{defi}[\hypertarget{def:directAnalCont}{Direct Analytic Continuation}]
    A \textbf{function element} (or \textbf{function germ}) on $U$ is a pair, $(f, D)$ where $f$ is analytic on the domain $D \subseteq U$.

    Two function elements $(f, D)$ and $g, E)$ are \textbf{equivalent} if $D \cap E \neq \emptyset$ and $f = g$ on $D \cap E$. In this case, we say $(g, E)$ is a \textbf{direct analytic continuation} of $(f, D)$.
\end{defi}

\begin{remark}
    This is not an equivalence relation.  In the diagram, $(f_1, D_1)$ and $(f_3, D_3)$ are not equivalent since $D_1 \cap D_3 = \emptyset$.
\end{remark}
% why do they do this to me :(

\begin{defi}[\hypertarget{def:pathAnalCont}{Analytic continuation along a path}]
    We say $(g, E)$ is an analytic continuation of $(f, D)$ along a path $\gamma: [0, 1] \to U$, written as $(f, D) \sim_\gamma (g, E)$.  If there exists $(f_1, D_1), \dotsc, (f_n, D_n)$ and $0 = t_0 < t_1 < \dots < t_n = 1$ with $\gamma([t_{i-1}, t_i]) \subseteq D_i$ for $1 \leq i \leq n$ and $(f_1, D_1) = (f, D)$, $(f_n, D_n) = (g, E)$ and $(F_{i-1}, D_{i-1}) \sim (F_i, D_i)$, that is $(f_i, D_i)$ is a \hyperlink{def:directAnalCont}{direct analytic continuation} of $f_{i-1}, D_{i-1}$.
\end{defi}


\begin{defi}[\hypertarget{def:analCont}{Analytic continuation}]
    We say $(g, E)$ is an analytic continuation of $(f, D)$ if there exists a path $\gamma$ with $(f, D) \sim_\gamma (g, E)$.  We write $(f, D) \approx (g, E)$.
\end{defi}

\begin{remark}
    $\approx$ is an equivalence relation.  Reflexivity and symmetry are easy, and transitivity can be seen from the diagram.
\end{remark}


\begin{defi}
    An equivalence class $\mathcal{F}$ under $\approx$ is a \textbf{complete analytic function}.
\end{defi}

\begin{eg}
    Set $U = \C^* = \C \setminus {0}$.  Fix $(\alpha, \beta) \subseteq \R$, with $\abs{\beta-\alpha} \leq 2 \pi$, and define
    \begin{equation*}E_{\alpha, \beta} = \set{z = r e^{i \theta} | \alpha < \theta < \beta \, , \; r > 0}\end{equation*}
    So we can see $U_1 = E_(0, 2 \pi)$.
    Define $f_{(\alpha, \beta)} : E_{(\alpha, \beta)} \to \C$ by $f_{(\alpha, \beta)} (r e^{i \theta}) = \log r + i \theta$, $\theta \in (\alpha, \beta)$.

    Write $L_{(\alpha, \beta)}$ for the function element $(f_{(\alpha, \beta)}, E_{(\alpha, \beta)})$.

    Consider the three function elements $L_{-\frac\pi2, \frac\pi2}$, $L_{\frac\pi6, \frac{7\pi}6}$, $L_{\frac{5\pi}6, \frac{11\pi}{6}}$
    We can see the direct analytic continuations, but we do not have direct analytic continuation (), but ().
\end{eg}

\begin{aim}
    Construct a surface on which $\log$ is well-defined by gluing together a bunch of domains on which it is well-defined.
\end{aim}

For each $n \in \Z$, take a copy of $U_1 = E_{(0, 2\pi)}$.  Each has a well-defined choice of logarithm: $f_{(2\pi n, 2\pi (n+1))}$, $r e^{i \theta} \mapsto \log r + (\theta + 2 \pi n) i$, for $\theta \in (0, 2\pi)$.

We can glue together these copies of $U$, so that the functions $f_{(2\pi n, 2\pi (n+1))}$ glue to give a continuous function $L : \tilde{U} \to \C$.

\begin{defi}[{Covering map}\hypertarget{def:coverMap}]
    A \textbf{covering map} of a topological space $X$ is is (sic) a continuous map $\pi: \widetilde X \to X$, where $\widetilde X$ and $X$ are Hausdorff and path connected, and $\pi$ is a local homeomorphism.  Specifically, $\forall \widetilde x \in \widetilde X$, $\exists$ an open neighbourhood $\widetilde N$ of $\widetilde{x}$ on which $\pi$ restricts to a homeomorphism.
    We say that $X$ is the \textbf{base space} of $\pi$.
\end{defi}
Note that this is likely weaker than the definition used in Algebraic Topology, which requires that $\forall x \in X$, $\exists$ an open neighbourhood $N$ of $x$ such that $\pi^{-1}(N)$ is a disjoint union of open sets which are mapped homeomorphically by $\pi$ to $N$.  We will call this a \textbf{regular} covering map.

\begin{eg}
    Non-regular covering map: Consider $\pi(z) = e^z$ on the domain
    \begin{equation}
        \set{z | 0 < \Im(z) < 4\pi}
    \end{equation}

    Let $x = 1$.  From the diagram, we have a disjoint union of open neighbourhoods, but $\pi$ does not map them homeomorphically.
\end{eg}

Define $R \coloneqq \sqcup_{n\in \Z} \C^* \times {n}$, and equip $R$ with the topology from basis with elements of the two forms:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item for $(\eta, n) \in R$ with $\eta \notin \R_{\leq 0}$ and any $r>0$, such that $\mathbb{D}(\eta, r) \cap \mathbb{R}_{\leq 0} = \emptyset$, define an open set $D((\eta, n), r)$ to be the disk of radius $r$ about $\eta$ in the $n$th sheet:
        \begin{equation}
            D((\eta, n), r) \coloneqq \set{(z, n) | \abs{z - \eta} < r}
        \end{equation}

    \item For $(\eta, n)$ with $\eta \in \R_{\leq 0}$, define
        \begin{equation}
            A((\eta, n), r) \coloneqq \set{(z, n) | \abs{z - \eta} < r, \ \Im{z} \geq 0} \sqcup {(z, n-1) | \abs{z - \eta} < r, \ \Im{z} < 0}
        \end{equation}
        where $r < \abs{\eta}$
\end{enumerate}

This defines a path-connected, Hausdorff topology on $R$. The map $\pi: \R \to \C^*$ given by $\pi((z, n)) = z$ is a (regular) covering map. Define $f:R \to \C$ by $f(r e^{i \theta}, n) = \log r + i (2 \pi n + \theta)$ where $\theta \in [0, 2\pi)$. By construction, $f$ is continuous, $f$ is also a bijection, and (diagram).
In this sense, $f$ is a logarithm.

Note we can similarly construct a gluing spae for $z^{1/n}$ as a multivalued function, $z^{1/n} = r^{1/n} e^{i \theta/n} e^{2 \pi k i/n}$ so the $n$th sheet glues to the first.
This is a regular covering map, but only because $0$ is not included.

\subsection{Power series and continuation}
Recall a power series is absolutely and uniformly convergent on any closed disk inside its radius of convergence. If that radius of convergence is not $\infty$, what can we say about how far the series can be analytically continued? Without loss of generality assume we are working on the unit disk $\mathbb{D}$, that is a series about zero and radius of convergence $1$.  We denote $\mathbb{T} \coloneqq \partial \mathbb{D}$ and write $f(z) = \sum_{k \geq 0} a_k z^k$.

\begin{defi}
    We say that $z \in \mathbb{T}$ is \textbf{regular} if $\exists$ an open disk $N$ about $z$ and an analytic function $g$ on $N$ such that $f = g$ on $N \cap \mathbb{D}$. If $z$ is not regular, it is \textbf{singular}.
\end{defi}

Note the collection of regular points is open, and the collection of singular points is closed.

Warning: regularity is independent of series convergence!
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
    \item $f(z) \coloneqq \sum_{k \geq 0} z^k$. This doesn't converge anywhere on $\mathbb{T}$, but as it agrees with $\frac1{1-z}$, all points except $z=1$ are regular.
    \item
        \begin{equation}
            g(z) \coloneqq \sum_{k=2}^\infty \frac{z^k}{k(k-1)}
        \end{equation}
        converges on $\mathbb{T}$ but $1$ is a singular point, as if $g$ extends analytically to a neighbourhood of $1$, so $g''$ does also, a contradiction.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{prop}
    If $f(z) = \sum a_k z^k$ has radius of convergence $1$, then $\exists$ singular point on $\mathbb{T}$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
    Suppose not, then for each $z \in \mathbb{T}$, $\exists D_z$ and analytic $g_z$ on $D_z$ with $f = g_z$ on $D_z \cap \mathbb{D}$. Given $z_1 \neq z_2$ on $\mathbb{T}$ with $D_{z_!} \cap D_{z_2} \neq \emptyset$, then since these are disks centered at points of $\mathbb{T}$, $D_{z_1} \cap D_{z_2} \cap \mathbb{D} \neq \emptyset$, so $f = g_{z_1} = g_{z_2}$ on $\mathbb{D} \cap D_{z_1} \cap D_{z_2}$. By the identity principle $g_{z_1} = g_{z_2}$ on $D_{z_1} \cap D_{z_2}$, as $\mathbb{T}$ is compact, it many be covered by finitely many of these disks, so $f$ can be extended to the union $\mathbb{D}$ with this finite colelction of $D_z$, and that union contains $\mathbb{D}(0, 1 + \delta)$ for some $\delta > 0$, contradiction.
\end{proof}

\begin{defi}
    We say $\mathbb{T}$ is a \textbf{natural boundary} of $f$ if every point $z \in \mathbb{T}$ is singular.
\end{defi}

\begin{eg}
    $f(z) \coloneqq \sum_{k=0}^\infty z^{k!}$. Let $\omega$ be a root of unity, $\omega = e^{2 \pi i p/q}$.
    Then
    \begin{align*}
        f(r e^{2\pi i p/q}) &= \sum_{k=0}^\infty r^{k!} (e^{2 \pi i p/q})^{k!} \\
                            &= \underbracket{\sum_{k=0}^{q-1} r^{k!} (e^{2 \pi i p/q})^{k!}}_{\text{bounded as} \; r \to 1} + \underbracket{\sum_{k=q}^\infty r^{k!}}_{\text{approaches} \; \infty \; \text{as} \; r \to 1}
    \end{align*}
