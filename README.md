My Part II notes

Will be updated with .tex files for backup purposes, but these should not be treated as clean.  On the other hand, `pdf` files can be treated as ready. I make no guarantees of accuracy or timing, but corrections or suggestions are always welcome.

For those interested in my setup, I use neovim inside tmux, with vimtex plugins and Skim as my viewwer.  Completion provided by deoplete and ultisnips.
